											<li>
													No unfair treatment will be meted out to a Whistleblower by virtue of his/her having reported an

													discrimination, harassment, victimization or any other unfair employment practice being adopted against
													Whistleblowers.
											</li>
											<li>
													If any Whistleblower feels that he/she is experiencing any kind of retaliation, victimization or discrimination in
													the nature of intimidation, pressure to withdraw the complaint or threats for reporting, testifying or otherwise
													participating in the investigation proceedings, he/she should report the matter to the Whistleblower
													Committee or the Ombudsman.
											</li>
											<li>
													As with complaints of Unethical/Non-Compliant Activities, such actions of retaliation, victimization or
													discrimination too will be treated as misconduct and upon notification and the Whistleblower Committee will
													immediately take appropriate action to prevent/rectify the retaliation, including, pending inquiry, temporarily
													suspend the perpetrator of any such alleged acts of retaliation or victimization from his/her employment until
													the completion of investigation of such retaliation, victimization or discrimination.
											</li>
											<li>
													Retaliation, victimization or discrimination in the nature of intimidation, pressure to withdraw the complaint or
													threats for reporting, testifying or otherwise participating in the investigation proceedings, will be treated as
													seriously, as an alleged case of Unethical/Non-Compliant Activity and will apply even if the original
													complaint is not proven and may result in the termination of employment of the perpetrator of such an act of
													retaliation/victimization/intimidation.
											</li>
											<li>
													The Company will take steps to minimize difficulties, which the Whistleblower may experience as a result of
													making the complaint of Unethical/Non-Compliant Activities. Thus, if the Whistleblower is required to give
													evidence in criminal or disciplinary proceedings, the Company will arrange for the Whistleblower to receive
													advice about the procedure, etc.
											</li>

													The identity of the Whistleblower shall be kept confidential under the highest degree of confidentiality that

													extent as the Whistleblower and are also entitled to the same degree of protection from retaliation for having
													participated in an investigation.
											</li>
											<li>
													It is hereby clarified that if at any time the investigation reveals that the Whistleblower was somehow
													involved in the reported Unethical/Non-Compliant Activity, the Whistleblower shall not be immune from
													being proceeded against with the same degree as the reported perpetrator of the Unethical/Non-Compliant
													Activity.
											</li>
										</ol>
									</li>
									<li>
										<h4>Secrecy/Confidentiality</h4>
										<ol>
											<li>The Whistleblower, the Subject, the members of Whistleblower Committee, the Ombudsman, the Participant and everyone involved in the process shall:

													considered fit by the Company.
											</li>
										</ol>
									</li>
									<li>
										<h4>Disqualifications</h4>
										<ol>
											<li>While it will be ensured that genuine Whistleblowers are accorded complete protection from any kind of
													unfair treatment as herein set out, any abuse of this protection will warrant disciplinary action.</li>
											<li>Protection under this Policy would not mean protection from disciplinary action arising out of false or bogus
													allegations made by a Whistleblower knowing it to be false or reported with a mala fide intention.</li>
